VGG1 PyPlot - The accuracies for train and test datasets are varying till 12 epochs and then the model becomes stable and closer to 100% accuarcy (stops learning)

VGG1 with Data Augmentation PyPlot - Data Augmnetation artificially expands the dataset. Hence, the model is capable of learning even after 20 epochs.
			Since, the model is still learning the accuracies for train and test datasets are still varying with the number of epochs, eventually converging to 100% accuracy.
 
Transfer Learning PyPlot - We can clearly see that the model fits the dataset quickly (2 epochs). Hence, we could perhaps regularize the model or provide a variety of datasets to increase the learning.
